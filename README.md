# psychedelic rainbow spiral (pure CSS, 1 element)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/kOzaYp](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/kOzaYp).

Should work in any browser that supports keyframe animations. If you get a timeout, decrease $n, $m or $p. Otherwise, you could even try increasing them. 

40 lines of SCSS (including variables & comments :P ).
